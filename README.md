## About 
I find myself using a lot of the same extensions and views in each of my projects. It started to become tedious keeping track of which projects I updated these in. By consolidating everything into this package the aim is to reduce time spent managing project files, and more time creating awesome things.

RSWTools is currently used in the following applications:

- [Study Sets](https://testflight.apple.com/join/rrIF6Vnc)
- [Body Insights](https://apps.apple.com/my/app/body-insights/id1397531585)
- [Cinematic](https://github.com/Rspoon3/Cinematic)
- [NYAB Field Service](https://apps.apple.com/kw/app/nyab-field-service/id1496562731) (Beta)

## Installation 

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)
Since Xcode integrated swift package manager natively into the IDE you can add SFSymbol simply by:

**`File`-> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency...`**

when prompted to enter a package URL paste: 

`https://github.com/Rspoon3/RSWTools` 


and click next & finish to automagically install SFSymbol through Xcode & SPM!

### Manual 
Don't want that additional third party dependency? Then just simply copy over the files into your project's appropriate folder!
